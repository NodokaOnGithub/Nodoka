# Rin's silly skinning conundrums 

# *These are some skins i made/edit over the past years.*

Skins not made by me that ive use will go here as well. 

Current skins im using right now are going to show up in my about me. 

If you are coming from github instead of my osu profile, my account can be found under here.

* [**osu!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13378004)

If any of the skin links dont work, just ask me on discord! (9rh)



   I doubt anyone is gonna look but if you are...

   thank you! <3 <3 <3
